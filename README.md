#Powerangels: break the mind, build the future

## Manifesto

When you're writing code or doing some day to day programming, do you feel that you want to stop thinking about trivial things and direct your activities to make a direct impact on the world's technology future? 

If the answer is yes - welcome to Powerangels.

We don't like to build CRUD applications, we don't have fun creating objects and moving them to and from the DB. We don't really get a lot of joy from making tons of simple web pages to display the server side work every day. We are not fans of fixing endless bugs that keep us away from getting closer to implementing challenging features and thinking on new mind blowing algorithms. These kinds of boring tasks make the wrong impression about what you can actually do. Programming isn't just a tool to solve these cortically subilluminated problems. 

We are autodidacts. We never stop learning. This is our oxygen - something that keeps us alive, that lives in the core of our soul and drives us every day, every second and every moment. We are focused on our research.

We are not "religious" in terms of programming languages, technologies or tools. We believe that each of them has it's own place and can be efficiently applied based on the practical task.

We dream. We dream big and have big ideas, which we always transform into goals. Sometimes they might even seem impossible. But we keep thinking about them and building plans how to achieve them in a real context.

Things that unite us are:
  * We fall down and break our mind every day
  * We work hard, learn and research topics we are interested in
  * We think about the future from the practical point of view
  * We are always searching for answers
  * We fail but continue onward every day
  * We want to make our lives better
  * We want to change the world for the better

Today programming has evolved in something that combines in itself a lot of different sciences. The core of them are: software engineering, mathematical fields, physics/hardware aspects and knowledge of the domain you're working in.

As for software engineering - it is the tool of futurebuilding that allows us to automate many things. But having just this one gives us nothing. We stand at the beginning of the next step, when the world is powered by data, when data is the source and the origin of everything - the questions and the answers.

Here comes mathematics. We can make magic in data science, data analysis and data modeling if we know and use the right algorithms. We can do machine learning, recommendations, predictions, prevent troubles by seeing anomalies. Data is everything - what we see, what we feel, what we touch... but this all can be transformed into something the machine can read. Data is messy. We need to teach ourselves how to extract data in the most efficient way, how to transform it into usable formats, filter it and determine the parts and features that really matter. 

Having all of this is good. But we need it to work everywhere. The world isn't just your machine. The world is devices and its diversity will dramatically increase with passing time.

...and we need this all to work rocketfast - we don't have spare milliseconds in our lives. 

We are language and technology independent - but the focus of this unity is data science, data processing, data analysis, machine learning, statistics, huge data volumes and it's processing, distributed and cloud programming, high load computations, quantum programming, functional programming, and other topics that are leading to the future.

##Why are we different from other communities?

We are all unique. Each of us has our own fights and stories of ups and downs. Each of us is very good at something in some specific field or topic that varies for all of us. We are learning, studying and researching something. Always. When reaching some particular level, being smart and curious, learning becomes harder and harder. When learning we always have questions. While studying the core foundations, questions are mostly stupid and information can be found in books and articles, questions can be answered on Stack Overflow or Quora. But when you are already good in the topic and continue growing, questions become more and more sophisticated and complex. Know the feeling of asking the question on Stack Overflow, having zero answers, having comments like “your question is too broad and isn't going to be easy”, sometimes being marked as “to philosophical”?... It’s when you are pushing the boundaries. Not all things are answered and described in books, sometimes we have to figure the answers out on our own. What unites us is not the technology, not the language, but being good at something, always searching for something, always having questions in our minds, and the lack of people like us, to share and discuss our technical worries and questions. You are not alone, believe.

##What are we doing here?


We are talking to each other, asking questions, sharing thoughts, searching for the answers to move us forward. Okay, well, it may seem a bit unmanageable, but it’s not. We follow the simple process that allows us to keep things in order and focus on the result and benefit each of the Powerangels gets after the conversation that can be virtual or in-person conversation, as well as hybrid. 
First of all, all Powerangels have the internal angel network portal. 


**Step #1. Join the Powerangel Portal and form your Curiosity Profile**

Before any conversation we should make sure that it makes sense. When each of the Powerangels join the portal, they write or select questions that they are interested in. They may pick their own questions as well as someone else’s. All questions that Poweralgels write are persisted and accessible for others, they are explorable and searchable. It allows to form the Curiosity Profile of Powerangels. When a Powerangel finds the question they’d like to discuss, to talk about, or to ask – it can be marked, which adds the questions to the Curiosity List of this particular Powerangel.

**Step #2. Discover kindred Powerangels’ spirits closest to yourself**

The Curiosity Profile is the connection unit that can unite two or more Powerangels together, based on questions they all are interested in finding answers to, or ready to discuss and share their knowledge and thoughts. The Curiosity Profile has a public appearance, which means it is accessible to other Powerangels. That implies, a Powerangel can discover other Powerangels that are closest to their technology curiosities. Each member has the list of 10 closest people based on the Curiosity Profile.

**Step #3. Ponder the way to set up the conversation with people you want**

After one of Powerangels discovers those people, he or she has an opportunity to invite them to the conversation that will be dedicated to questions shared accross their Curiosity Profiles. The Powerangels who receive the invitation may accept it without any changes, as well as propose new place/time or reject it. As soon as at least 1 of the other Powerangels agreed to participate – the event is counted as planned and appears on the shared list of planned conversations, which is visible to all Powerangels. 

**Step #4. Choose the place for the conversation**

It may be any place, depending on what everyone’s preferences are. People who are near each other may go to their favorite coffee shops, people from different parts of the world may prefer to set up the Slack channel or audio/video call for the discussion.

**Step #5. Get notified about the planned conversation you might be interested in**

As the main ground for the event are sophisticated questions that Powerangels always have, all people who are not the part of the event yet, but who have one or more questions from that event in their Curiosity Profile, they will get the notification about the event and the opportunity to join.

**Step #6. Conclusions. A conversation starts with questions, let’s end it with answers**

Every Powerangel is interested in getting the real value from all conversations and discussions on topics they’re fond of. Conversations are just the way to bring a Powerangel closer to their dreams, by providing answers or at least tips. A conversation is based on the predefined questions, so it’s logical to summarize the finished discussion by doing a quick write up of discussion results and conclusions. In a lot of cases, one single Powerangel conversation may not lead to the direct answer, but that doesn’t mean that it was useless. The conversation summary is a way to show the indicator of progress, be it the answer, or a list of new questions that appeared during the discussion. It is helpful for all members. For people who were the part of the discussion – it helps to stay focused and make the progressive movement forward. It is also helpful for people who missed the conversation – they can learn the opinions of their kindred spirits by reading the summary of discussing the questions from their Curiosity Profile and make their own conclusions, generate their own new questions. 


##Membership

Feel like a Powerangel? 

To participate in conversations with other Powerangels, discuss various topics you’re interested in, join nonstandard angel conversations and technical activities, we need you to tell us about yourself a little bit:


1.	What is your passion?
*	What are you hacking on and thinking about during your spare time?
*	What you believe is the future?
*	What topics and fields are you fond of?
*	Are these topics the part of your day to day job or are you enjoying them in your spare time?
*	How many hours/days a week do you spend to learning something new in the area of your interest, just in average?
*	What are some of the questions that you’d like to discuss with other Powerangels?
*	Would you like to participate in virtual or in-person discussions, or both?
*	Want to share your twitter, github, blog with us?
*	Send what you’ve come up with to [welcome.powerangels@gmail.com](mailto:welcome.powerangels@gmail.com)

It’s not necessary to answer all of these questions, not necessary to answer them all in exact order they are listed. You may just write us about yourself in a way you prefer. We just need to understand who you are and if you are ready to join the club. We will come back to you shortly after you send the letter to us!

And hey, notice that the focus of all these questions is programming and science. You may add the phrase “in terms of programming” to the end of each question. When you write answers, don’t think about stuff you’re not a fan of, write about things that make your eyes shine like a fire, write about things that you can’t share with people around because you don’t see someone who would really understand that your ideas and thoughts are amazing, or if you can’t find the right path to your problem resolution even after doing a big research on the topic, looking through books, articles, white papers, searching the people who might help both, around and on the internet, but no results. Powerangels is the right place with people who are inspired, who are fond of what they’re doing and curious about future perspective topics. Thinking on complicated questions together makes magic.

##Help us grow

Powerangels is going to be the mightiest community in the world, concentrating the most curious and smart people who are in love with what they are doing. We are still new, but we are growing. You can help us grow by either joining us or sharing! We need to share our existence with the world to make people aware of us. Wake up, angels. Spread the word!

##Powerangels: break the mind, build the future

When you're writing code or doing some day to day programming, do you feel that you want to stop thinking about trivial things and direct your activities to make the direct impact on the world's technology future? 

If the answer is yes - welcome to the Powerangels. 

We don't like to build CRUD applications, we don't have fun creating objects and moving them to and from the DB. We're not enjoying making tons of simple web pages to display the server side work every day. We are not fans of fixing endless bugs that keep us away from getting closer to implementing challenging features and thinking on new mind breaking algorithms. These kinds of boring tasks make wrong impression about what you can actually do. Programming isn't just a tool to solve these simple kid-level problems. 

We are autodidacts. We never stop learning. This is our air - something that keeps us alive, that lives in the core of our soul and drives us every day, every second and every moment. We are focused and concentrated on our research. 

We are not "religious" in terms of programming languages, technologies or tools. We believe that each of them has it's own place and can be efficiently applied based on the practical task. 

We dream. We dream big and have big ideas, which we always transform into goals. Sometimes they might even seem impossible. But we keep thinking about them and building plans how to achieve them for real. 

Things that unite us are:
  * We fall and break our mind every day
  * We work hard, learn and research topics we are interested in more than others do
  * We think about the future from the practical point of view
  * We want to make our lives better
  * We want to change the world for the better

Programming nowadays has already evolved in something that combines in itself a lot of different sciences. Main of them currently are: software engineering, mathematical fields, physics/hardware aspects and knowledge of the domain you're working in. 

As for software engineering - this one is for sure the big tool of futurebuilding that allows us to automate lots of things. But having just this one gives us nothing. We stand at the beginning of the new step, when the world is powered by data, when data is the source and the origin of everything - questions and answers. We need to make friends with data. 

Here comes mathematics - we can make magic in data science, data analysis and data modeling if we know and use the right algorithms. We can do machine learning, recommendations, predictions, prevent troubles by seeing anomalies. Data is everything - what we see, what we feel, what we touch... but this all can be transformed into something the machine can read. Data is messy. We need to teach ourselves how to extract data in the most efficient way, how to transform it into usable format, filter it and determine the parts and features that really matter. 

Having this all is good. But we need it to work everywhere. World isn't just your machine. World is devices and is going to become more and more diverse with the time going. 

And we need this all work rocketfast - we don't have spare milliseconds in our lives. 

We are language and technology independent - but the focus of this unity is data science, data processing, data analysis, machine learning, statistics, huge data volumes and it's processing, distributed and cloud programming, high load computations, quantum programming, functional programming, and other topics that are perspective for the future.

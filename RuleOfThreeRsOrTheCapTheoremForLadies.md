Imagine you have a boyfriend or a husband and you need to ask him to do something very important for you. This post is aiming to explain that girls shouldn't demand everything at once from their sweethearts. They are not superheroes yet. They are people and don't blame them for being both ignorant or irresponsible. You can blame for just one of these personal characteristics. Here is why.

**Responsibility**

He is very responsible and is always doing what he has promised to do. It is true not only for you, but for all other people who have ever asked him something. But if you asked him something he will definitely do it correct exactly in a way you asked him to do it. However, as he is very focused on getting stuff done, it may take some time and if he promised to help his friends first, maybe you'd have to wait and have no news from him.

**Reaction**

He is very social and will always respond to all of your questions. The most important thing for him is to be connected to everyone all the time. He will say something to you even if your question doesn't make sense. Therefore, he is very busy with comminication and keeping his communication channels open, so, if your question contains a favor, there it takes some time for him to perform your request 100% correct immediately. However, he will finally do it correct, someday... eventually.

**Reach**

There is a few ways you can reach him to ask for something. You can use mobile connection, you can use internet, you can find him in real life and tell him what you want from him. So, there is a number of ways to reach him. He is also very much relying on all these communication channels because most likely he'd need to interact with other people or entities through them to fulfilll your request. However, we can never guarantee that they will work. It's so unreliable, internet always fails, phones are always crashing, people are such introverts to talk in person.



A little bit more to add here. 

First, if you have followed the logic, to ask the darling you have to transfer your request to him by any means, otherwise you will just not get any response. He also needs the ability to connect to other stuff to help you. So communication channels are the most important here. We can't live without it. 

Second, you can't make the sweetie to always react to your calls and messages if he has a lot of work and if getting things done is the main priority for him. Yes, he is focused on his work to be able to make your family life better, not because he is selfish! On the other hand, if the main thing for him is the impression of other people, so he is always trying to respond to their questions, which takes a lot of time. So, he can't actually perform some complex tasks as fast as you wish! But he will do it, eventually.

So girls, be smart and don't terrorize the ones you love.
